# Process-Automation
Demonstration on automating the process of applying to jobs online.

This is a demo as to how one can automate the whole process of applying to jobs manually on any given platform. For illustration purposes, I have taken an example of [Angel List](https://angel.co) website.

Things you will need:
- An account on Angel List
- A chrome browser (recommended). Note that you can use any browser you want by just replacing the webdriver as per the browser you are using.
- [Python](https://www.python.org) and [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/) Installed.
- [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org) if you are using chrome.
